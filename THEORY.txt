features of java
--simple -> easy to use , easy to learn

--java -> purely object oriented , c++ not purely object oriented

-- class -> is a collction of various mathods and members

--platform independent -> compiled file can run on any device mac/os window linux through jvm
        a program made from java will run on all device , but in c++ it only runs on present code

--secured -> best for security, develop virus-free systems 
   -- no explicit pointer
   --java program run inside a virtual machine sandbox

--robust(strong) -> is uses strong memory management
                 ->automatic garbage collection(releases memory automatically which is not used)


--architectural-neural -> in c programming , two-architecture 32 bit and 64 bit 
                          but in java only 64 bit , both will run on 64 only ,(32bit and 64bit)
                    

--portable -> faciliates you to carry .exe files because because it can run on every device

--distributes -> this feature of java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet

--multi-threaded -> a thread is like a seperate program,executing concurrently.we can write java
                that deals with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.

--dynamic --> java is a dynamic language . it supports the dynamic loading of classes.classes are loaded
              on demand it also support functions from its native language like c and c++

-- normal vs jagged array --

normal -> int [][] a=, new int [2][3]; 
occupy more memory
time complexity less


jagged array -> int [][] a= ,new int[2][]; 
columns are decided at run time 
less memory required
time complexity more
